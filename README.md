# quidditch-pong

Quidditch Pong is a fun, not-so-Sirius (see what I did there) game I created as part of my Harvard CS50 course, using MIT's visual-based language known as Scratch. The game is a Harry Potter themed tribute to the famous Atari game Pong that was released in 1972. You can download the .sb3 file to play the game offline, on your local computer but you'll likely need to download the Scratch Desktop app to do so (instructions for the game are included in the download). The easier way to play the game, is to play it online, with the following link: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/390000499. Scratch is a very beginner friendly language but I have found it a useful tool for both teaching programming concepts, fleshing out rough program ideas, plus, it's just plain fun to play with. I hope you enjoy!
