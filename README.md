# quidditch-pong

Quidditch Pong is a fun, not-so-Sirius (see what I did there) game I created as part of my Harvard CS50 course, using MIT's visual-based language known as Scratch. The game is a Harry Potter themed tribute to the famous Atari game; Pong. You'll find instructions for playing the game within the sb3 file that the game is in. Scratch is a very beginner friendly language but I have found it a useful tool for both teaching programming concepts, fleshing out rough program ideas, and it's just plain fun to play with.
